120% compatible with vanilla

Add a Skeleton Race.

Those who should have died a long time ago were revived for unknown reasons.

Basically it has low health and slow working speed, but it can survive in extreme environments without sleeping and food.

Languages: English, Korean, Russian

-update note-

2019/1/17 - no more need sleep

2019/1/25 - add russian translation (thanks ✿4ecHoK❀)
