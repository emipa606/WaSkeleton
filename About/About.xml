Update of Dalraes mod
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1627043991

- Added an option to turn off the death-explosions

- Reanimation can be selective to only colonists and/or only buried pawns
- Added compatibility with mass graves
- Added an option to sometimes spawn zombies, textures by S-Purple
- Added an option to make enemy pawns spawn in aggro state, zombies get manhunter and skeletons try to attack the colony.
- Added an option to only ressurect during eclipses

120% compatible with vanilla

Add a Skeleton Race.

Those who should have died a long time ago were revived for unknown reasons.

Basically it has low health and slow working speed, but it can survive in extreme environments without sleeping and food.

Languages: English, Korean, Russian

-update note-

2019/1/17 - no more need sleep

2019/1/25 - add russian translation (thanks ✿4ecHoK❀)
