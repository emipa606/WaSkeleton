- Added an option to turn off the death-explosions
- Added an option to reanimate dead pawns as skeletons

- Reanimation can be selective to only colonists and/or only buried pawns
- Added compatibility with mass graves

- Added an option to make enemy pawns spawn in aggro state, zombies get manhunter and skeletons try to attack the colony.
- Added an option to only ressurect during eclipses
- Added an option to ressurect all corpses at once, for a more challenging play
- Added an option to set the ressurection chance generally
- Added an option to define secure graves that corpses cannot ressurect from

- Updated russian translation, thanks Tkhakiro
- Added more bodytypes for the skeletons, thanks to the graphics from the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2610132116]Spooky Scary Skeletons[/url] mod. Very nice of Kasmex_Forever to let me use them and for Stokeling9701 for the idea!
- Zombies and Skeletons now have brains for psycasting, thanks TheCakeIsALie!

120% compatible with vanilla

Add a Skeleton Race.

Those who should have died a long time ago were revived for unknown reasons.

Basically it has low health and slow working speed, but it can survive in extreme environments without sleeping and food.

Languages: English, Korean, Russian

-update note-

2019/1/17 - no more need sleep

2019/1/25 - add russian translation (thanks ✿4ecHoK❀)
